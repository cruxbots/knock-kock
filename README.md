# Knock Knock who's there

## Why I am making this

There are couple of guests in my house and for some reason they like to come in my room and touch my desk. It's not out of mallice but sometimes curosity and sometimes they want to keep stuff on my desk or pick something from here. Regardless, i don't like anyone to touch my things:

## Introduction

Using YOLO and bark tts i am making an system which will detect if there is a person in the frame and start shouting at them! New features will be added further in time!
